# STEMM Role Models Style Guide

This document outlines basic aesthetic guidelines to use for all STEMM Role Models documents. Adhering to these basic formatting and aesthetic principles across all of our documents (website, social media, newsletters, etc.) we hope to create a cohesive presence and identity. 

### Fonts

* Whenever possible, use Gill Sans MT font. 
* When Gill Sans is not an available option (e.g. platforms with limited font selections like MailChimp), use a sans serif font with slightly rounded letters. Helvetica, Arial, and Veranda are common web-safe options. 
* If a serif font is desired (e.g. for long-form text documents), use Georgia

### Logos

There are several different versions of the STEMM Role Models logo used for different purposes. 

* The full logo: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/gh-pages/SchematicDesign/logo_full_160911.png" width="300" align="right"/>

    The full logo should only be used when there is space for a large image (e.g. website homepage).

* The small square logo: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/gh-pages/SchematicDesign/logo_square_160911.png" width="300" align="right"/>

    These logos should be used for social media and small icons. 

* The banner logo: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/gh-pages/SchematicDesign/logos_banner_160911.png" width="300" align="right"/>

    This should be used for banners, such as newsletters or headings at the top of a webpage. The version with the color gradients should only be used when the logo is sufficiently large that the detail will be visible.


### Colors and usage

All documents should be designed around a color scheme of teal, orange, and gray. White and black can also be used as accents and/or for text as needed. The specific shades are:

* Dark teal
  * RGB = (30, 147, 148)
  * webSafe RGB = (1E, 93, 94)
  * CMYK = (80, 23, 43, 2)
  * HSB = (180.5, 78, 58)
* Light teal
  * RGB = (116, 203, 201)
  * webSafe RGB = (74, CB, C9)
  * CMYK = (52, 0, 24, 0)
  * HSB = (178.5, 42.8, 79.5)
* Dark orange
  * RGB = (222, 97, 23)
  * webSafe RGB = (DE, 61, 17)
  * CMYK = (8.5, 75, 100, 1)
  * HSB = (22.3, 89.5, 87)
* Light orange
  * RGB = (237, 170, 130)
  * webSafe RGB = (ED, AA, 82)
  * CMYK = (4.75, 37.5, 50, 0)
  * HSB = (22.5, 45.1, 93)

  * HSB = (216, 3.7, 52)
* Medium gray
  * RGB = (209, 211, 212)
  * webSafe RGB = (D1, D3, D4)
  * CMYK = (17, 12, 12.4, 0)
  * HSB = (200, 1.4, 83.1)
* Light gray
  * RGB = (241, 242, 242)
  * webSafe RGB = (F1, F2, F2)
  * CMYK = (4, 2.3, 2.6, 0)
  * HSB = (180, 0.4, 94.9)

### Usage principles:

In general, opt for gray and either teal or orange in the majority of a design. The other color should be used sparingly as an accent. 

Use color consistently across a design. For instance, in the profile page layout, teal is used for accents related to information (i.e. category headings, links, etc.) while orange is used for action items (e.g. leaving a testimonial, login, etc.).
