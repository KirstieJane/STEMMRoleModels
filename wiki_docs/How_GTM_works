User can add or manage the AdWords, Google analytics, Flood-light and non-Google tags using the GTM.

**How it works**
  Followings are main components of the GTM:

**Account**
Each account can contains multiple containers
**"One account per company/organization"**

**Container**
A container includes the tracking tags (e.g. Google Analytics, AdWords Conversion Tracking tags) that you want to use on the website.
**"One container for one website"**

**Tags**
Tags are snippets of code on your site that collect data
**"A tag must have at least one rule in order to fire"**
Google Tag Manager supports following tag types which can be use directly:
  1. AdWords Conversion Tracking
  2. DoubleClick Floodlight Counter
  3. DoubleClick Floodlight Sales
  4. Google Analytics
  5. GDN Remarketing

There are other two custom tags available which allows you to implement custom tags which are not available in above list:
  1. Custom Image Tag
  2. Custom HTML Tag
  
**Rules**
The rule(s) attached to a tag govern when the tag is fired or not fired.
**"A rule that blocks a tag from firing always overrides a firing rule"**
Syntax: **[Macro] [Operator] [Value]**
Example: **url** equals **example.com/index.html**

**Macros**
Macros supply dynamic data to tags and conditions.
**"Macros are name-value pairs for which the value is populated during runtime"**

**Types of Macro**
  
  1. Constant String
  2. JavaScript Variable
  3. Data Layer
  4. DOM Text
  5. Dom attribute
  6. URL
  7. Custom Event
  8. HTTP Referrer
