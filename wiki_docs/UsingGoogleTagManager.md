Google Tag Manager allows you track data for events like page views, clicks, and other user interaction through a GUI. It's easier than hard coding events to track and also has a good debugging tool which you can use before pushing to a production environment. 
Google Tag Manager allows you track data for events like page views, clicks, and other user interaction through a GUI. It's easier than hard coding events to track and also has a good debugging tool which you can use before pushing to a production environment. Google Tag Manager is a place where you store all of the individual tracking codes and use rules to state when they should fire. It's basically like a big empty box that sites on your site. As the page loads or when you interact on the site, it sends a request to a huge database that Google holds online. It will go to the section of the database that holds your accounts information. It will then look at all of the tags in your account and find which ones match the criteria of the action that just happened (like a page load or button click), it will then fire the tags that meet these requirements in the same way that your tracking codes used to fire when directly on the site .

Note: GTM provides Google Analytics data and so there is no need to include an additional GA script.
