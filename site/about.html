            <h1>All about us</h1>

            <h2>Where we came from</h2>

            <p>In February of this year the STEMM Role Models team (Kirstie, Amy, Erin
              and Elizabeth) won the runners up prize in the
              <a href="http://www.rfappathon.org/about" target="_blank">Rosalind Franklin appathon</a>,
              a national competition to find the best ideas to harness the power of
              mobile technology to support women in Science, Technology, Engineering,
              Maths and Medicine.
            </p>

            <h5>The problem</h5>

            <p>We sought to tackle the problem that women are less likely to be invited
              to speak at conferences, even when you take into account their lower
              representation in senior positions as a whole. We know the confidence that
              young researchers build when they see people "just like them" in
              leadership roles and we know that increasing diversity can inspire the
              most creative ideas across all fields of STEMM and at every step along the
              academic career trajectory.
            </p>

            <h5>The solution</h5>

            <p>We proposed a database that conference organisers could use to widen their
              reach when considering which researchers to invite to speak or to sit on
              panels. Each profile contains information about the researcher's skills,
              publications, previous speaking engagements etc, as well as their
              membership of some of the typically under-represented groups in leadership
              positions in STEMM: women, people of colour/black minority ethnic, people
              with a disability, LGBTQ and parent or carer.
            </p>

            <h5>What makes us different</h5>

            <p>Two important aspects set the STEMM Role Models project apart from current
              tools (such as google!) that can be used to create speaker lists 1)
              members of the database can be recommended by anyone (department
              administrators, prinicipal investigators, funding agencies) thus
              minimizing the effect of the imposter complex that causes women to promote
              themselves less than men, and 2) we will curate testimonials from members
              of the community who have seen the women speak to facilitate conference
              organisers to build the very best program they can.
            </p>

            <h5>Open development</h5>

            <p>We are also dedicated to open source development and providing
              opportunities for women and other under-represented groups to build their
              confidence working in an online collaborative environment. We welcome
              anyone of any level of experience and at any career stage (including our
              friends outside the ivory tower of academia!) to join us in our adventure
              to build the website and assocated mobile app.
            </p>
