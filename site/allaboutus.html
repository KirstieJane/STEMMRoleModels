      <h1>All about us</h1>

      <h2>Where we came from</h2>

      <p>In February of this year the STEMM Role Models team (Kirstie, Amy, Erin
      and Elizabeth) won the runners up prize in the
      <a href="http://www.rfappathon.org/about">Rosalind Franklin appathon</a>,
      a national competition to find the best ideas to harness the power of
      mobile technology to support women in Science, Technology, Engineering,
      Maths and Medicine.</p>

      <h3>The problem</h3>

      <p>We sought to tackle the problem that women are less likely to be invited
      to speak at conferences, even when you take into account their lower
      representation in senior positions as a whole. We know the confidence that
      young researchers build when they see people "just like them" in
      leadership roles and we know that increasing diversity can inspire the
      most creative ideas across all fields of STEMM and at every step along the
      academic career trajectory.</p>

      <h3>The solution</h3>

      <p>We proposed a database that conference organisers could use to widen their
      reach when considering which researchers to invite to speak or to sit on
      panels. Each profile contains information about the researcher's skills,
      publications, previous speaking engagements etc, as well as their
      membership of some of the typically under-represented groups in leadership
      positions in STEMM: women, people of colour/black minority ethnic, people
      with a disability, LGBTQ and parent or carer.</p>

      <h3>What makes us different</h3>

      <p>Two important aspects set the STEMM Role Models project apart from current
      tools (such as google!) that can be used to create speaker lists 1)
      members of the database can be uploaded by anyone (department
      administrators, prinicipal investigators, funding agencies) thus
      minimizing the effect of the imposter complex that causes women to promote
      themselves less than men, and 2) we will curate testimonials from members
      of the community who have seen the women speak to facilitate conference
      organisers to build the very best program they can.</p>

      <h3>Open development</h3>

      <p>We are also dedicated to open source development and providing
      opportunities for women and other under-represented groups to build their
      confidence working in an online collaborative environment. We welcome
      anyone of any level of experience and at any career stage (including our
      friends outside the ivory tower of academia!) to join us in our adventure
      to build the website and assocated mobile app.</p>
