# Docker Engine: Lightweight runtime environment and container packaging tool.
# Docker Hub: Public container repository

# Installing Docker on Windows
Install the latest Docker for Windows built from here: https://github.com/boot2docker/windows-installer/releases/tag/v1.5.0 from its GitHub repo.
After accepting this installation, we'll get the following three components:

--> Boot2Docker Management tool and ISO: This is the Docker administration command-line interface (CLI).
--> VirtualBox: We need the core of the Oracle VirtualBox VM desktop virtualization product to allow us to run the core Linux code from inside Windows.
--> MSYS-git UNIX tools: The Docker Hub will pull containers from public Git repositories, so we need to have client tools available on our system.

Next, double-click the pretty Boot2Docker Start Desktop icon to start the Boot2Docker management tool.  We'll prompted to allow VirtualBox to bind two virtual network interfaces, and before long we’ll see a decidedly Linux-y command prompt.

# Now, to verify that Docker is functioning correctly, run the following command from the Boot2Docker client:
docker run hello-world

# Do Docker Stuff
docker version 
then,
docker help

If all goes well, we’ll see a bunch of explanatory text on your screen.
