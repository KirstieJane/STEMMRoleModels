# Ubuntu uses systemd as its boot and service manager 15.04 onwards and upstart for versions 14.10 and below.
# For 15.04 and up, to configure the docker daemon to start on boot, run
$ sudo systemctl enable docker

# For 14.10 and below the above installation method automatically configures upstart to start the docker daemon on boot

# To install the latest version of Docker with apt-get:
$ sudo apt-get upgrade docker-engine
